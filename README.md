## Final Notes

This project was quite a challenge for me. Initially, I had used too many containers in the HTML, which didn't... yielded satisfactory results. So, in the second run, I simplified the HTML, it worked pretty well. The colored image also gave me a hard time, especially because I didn't want to use Google's main solutions. In the end, everything worked out and I managed to achieve the final result that I was aiming for
